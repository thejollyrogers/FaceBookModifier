        <h1>Advanced</h1>
    
            <p><strong>SECURMOUNT</strong> has created a series of patent pending, UL certified, flat
            
            panel TV wall mounts that combine durability, ease of installation,
            
            and universal adaptability that you need!</p>
    
        
        <h1>Easy</h1>
    
            <p>Our products have all been designed to be installer friendly. Based 
            
            on installer surveys, our mounts have been rated as being easier and faster 
            
            to install.</p>
    
            <p><strong>SECURMOUNT</strong> not only created mounting systems to make the
            
            installation process extremely easy, but has also built our business
            
            to be as simple and flexible as possible so we can offer superior customer 
            
            service.  That is why we offer various business and distribution models to 
            
            accommodate our retailer and partner needs (big or small!).</p>
    
        
        <h1>Affordable</h1>
            
           <p> <strong>SECURMOUNT</strong> understands the LCD/Plasma flat panel TV market is rapidly growing and
            
            becoming more competitive.  That is why we created products that will save 
            
            our customers on the cost of product, shelf space, installation, shipping, and  
            
            storage.  This translates to higher profit margins for our customers.</p>
